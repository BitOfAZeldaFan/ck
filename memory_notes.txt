This is just a list of memory locations I'm using to store important global 
variables. Eventually I'll implement these in code with better documentation, 
but for now the docs live here.

First memory segment free for use is at 0x500.
I'll split it into 16 bit words, each word being a global variable. 
Probably.

Word      Function
