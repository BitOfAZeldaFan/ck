This is just a list of memory locations I'm using to store important global 
variables. Eventually I'll implement these in code with better documentation, 
but for now the docs live here.

First memory segment free for use is at 0x400.
I'll split it into 16 bit words, each word being a global variable. 
Probably.

Word      Function
0x400     Textmode cursor position (in units of characters starting at 0)
0x401     VGA textmode foreground color
0x402     VGA textmode background color
